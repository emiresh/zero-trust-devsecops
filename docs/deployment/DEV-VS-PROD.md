# Docker Compose: Development vs Production

## Quick Comparison

| Aspect | Development Mode | Production Mode |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **File** | `docker-compose.dev.yml` | `docker-compose.yml` |
| **Code Changes** |  Auto-reload (instant) |  Requires rebuild (~30s-2min) |
| **Hot Module Replacement** |  Yes (Frontend) |  No |
| **Build Time** | Fast (first time only) | Slow (every change) |
| **Container Size** | Large (dev dependencies) | Small (optimized) |
| **Use Case** | Daily development | Testing final build |
| **Speed** |  Instant feedback |  Rebuild for each change |

## Commands Cheat Sheet

### Development (Fast Iteration)
```bash
# Start dev environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# Make code changes → They auto-reload! ✨

# Stop when done
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

### Production (Final Testing)
```bash
# Build and test production containers
docker-compose up --build -d

# Test everything works
docker ps
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

## When to Use Each

### Use Development Mode When:
- Building new features
- Debugging issues
- Testing code changes quickly
- Writing/updating documentation
- **Default for daily work**

### Use Production Mode When:
- Testing final build before deployment
- Validating Docker configurations
- Testing production environment variables
- Preparing for deployment
- **Only before commits/releases**

## Developer Workflow

    A[Start Dev Mode] --> B[Code Changes]
    B --> C{Auto Reload}
    C --> D[Test Immediately]
    D --> B
    D --> E{Feature Complete?}
    E -->|No| B
    E -->|Yes| F[Test Production Build]
    F --> G[Commit & Push]
```

**Bottom line:** Use `docker-compose.dev.yml` for 95% of your work!
